# kitty
Theme for the Kitty terminal app

## Usage

Copy and paste the contents of `electron_highlighter.conf` at the bottom of your `kitty.conf` file, then reload Kitty to see changes applied.

### What if I have an existing theme?

If you've set a theme using Kitty's built-in theme picker, you likely have a file called `current-theme.conf`. If that's the case, you can copy and paste the contents of `electron_highlighter.conf` into that file (delete the previous contents first).
