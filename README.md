# kitty

Theme for the Kitty terminal app

## Usage

Electron Highlighter is included as a theme in Kitty. You can update your theme in Kitty by using the built-in `theme` kitten. Run this in your terminal:

```
kitten themes
```

You'll find Electron Highlighter in there to select from, and Kitty will update your config for you.

### Alternative installation

If you prefer, you can copy the contents of the config file located in this repository and paste them into your own config file (that is all the `kitten` script does).
